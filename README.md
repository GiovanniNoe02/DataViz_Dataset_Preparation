# DataViz_Dataset_Preparation
This is the dataset preparation for the project of the Data Visualization course A.Y. 2024/2025 of the Master's degree in Data Science in University of Milano Bicocca.

In this repository you'll find a Jupyter Notebook file with the code that was used to create the dataframe for the project, 
a folder with additional data taken from sources different from Kaggle and a text file that explains the process.

Edit: You can now also find the project's final presentation here.
